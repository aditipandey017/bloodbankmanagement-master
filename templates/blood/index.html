    <h3 class="text-left"><b>Why should you donate blood?</b></h3>

    <p>Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but it can make a big difference in the lives of others.
       The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. 
       The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average. The process is safe and sterile. 
       A single donation can save as many as three lives. You will feel good knowing you've helped change a life.
       Donating blood is a vital and selfless act that saves lives and improves health for countless individuals. 
       Blood donations are essential for treating patients who suffer from trauma, undergo surgeries, or battle diseases like cancer and anemia.
       Each donation can help up to three people, making a significant impact on the well-being of others. Regular blood donations also help maintain a stable blood supply,
       ensuring that hospitals and clinics are prepared for emergencies. Moreover, the process of donating blood is safe, quick, and relatively painless,
       with donors often experiencing a sense of fulfillment knowing they have contributed to their community. Additionally, blood donation has health benefits for the donor,
       including a free health screening and the potential for reduced risk of certain health conditions. Ultimately, 
       donating blood is a simple yet profound way to give back and support the health and survival of those in need. </p>

          <h3 class="text-left"><b>Types of donation</b></h3>
          <p>There are several types of blood donations, 
            each serving unique and critical purposes in medical care. 
            Whole blood donation is the most common type, where donors give about a pint of blood that can be separated into red cells,
            plasma, and platelets. Platelet donation, or apheresis, involves collecting only platelets, 
            which are crucial for cancer patients and those undergoing major surgeries. 
            Plasma donation, another form of apheresis, extracts plasma, 
            the liquid part of the blood, vital for treating patients with liver conditions, 
            burns, and severe infections. Double red cell donation allows donors to give two units of red blood cells in one sitting, 
            benefiting patients with severe blood loss or chronic anemia. Each type of donation plays an essential role in saving lives
            and supporting the diverse needs of patients. By understanding and participating in these various donation types, 
            donors can make a significant difference in the health and recovery of those in need. </p>
